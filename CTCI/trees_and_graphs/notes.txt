A node is called a leaf node if it has no children.

Trees vs Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children.

Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
A Binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific property.
Property - (all left descendants <= n <= all right descendants)

Complete Binary Trees
Every node has zero or no children. No node with 1 child.

Perfect Binary Tree
Both full and complete binary tree results in perfect binary tree.
No of nodes - 2^k - 1

Binary Tree Traversal

Inorder Traversal-
Print - Left -> Root -> right

Pre-Order Traversal -
Root -> Left -> right

Post-Order Traversal
Left -> Right -> Root

Binary Heaps - 
Min Heap - Complete Binary Tree where each node is smaller than its children.
Root is the smallest element in the tree.

Tries (Prefix Trees):
A trie is a variant of an n-ary tree in which characters are stored at each node.
Each path down the tree may represent a word.

Graphs
A tree is actually a type of graph but all not all graphs are trees.
A tree is a connected graph without cycles.
A graph is a collection of nodes with edges between some of them.

2 Types to represent graphs-
Adjacency List (Dictionary/List)
Adjacency Matrix (NxN Array with boolean values)

Graph Search-
2 most common ways-
Depth First Search
Breadth First Search
