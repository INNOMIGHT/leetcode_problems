A node is called a leaf node if it has no children.

Trees vs Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree in which each node has up to two children.

Binary Tree vs Binary Search Tree
A Binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific property.
Property - (all left descendants <= n <= all right descendants)

Complete Binary Trees
Every node has zero or no children. No node with 1 child.

Perfect Binary Tree
Both full and complete binary tree results in perfect binary tree.
No of nodes - 2^k - 1
